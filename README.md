# Basic-Login

The above is a basic php login system. I was having problems downloading the folder onto github that contained the .php files. So let me know if you run into any problems!

===FAQ===
1.What is this project supposed to do?
a: This is a project for me learning how to build a login system and to grab information from input fields within an HTML file. So while nothing really happens on the website besides ERRORS and LOGINS, information is being sent to the database on the host server. 

2.How do I run the .php files?
a: Download the .rar file to your desired location. KEEP TRACK OF IT, we'll need it soon! Next you'll need a localhost. I used XAMPP - an opensource web server/interpreter for PHP AND PERL languages. Type localhost/phpmyadmin into your browser. Click on the DATABASES tab on the top of the page. In the DATABASE NAME field type "phptest" and click CREATE. CONGRATS the database is good to go.
Now, locate the .rar file. Copy/cut it and navigate to your XAMPP folder. Inside the XAMPP folder there will be an "htdocs" folder with junk inside. Delete junk if necessary and extract the LOGIN SYSTEM folder here. Make sure to startup XAMPP and turn ON APACHE AND MySQL in ACTIONS. Next, go back to the broswer and type LOCALHOST into the ADDRESS-BAR. Click on LOGIN SYSTEM and you're good to go!

3. The ABOUT US and FIND BLOGS tabs are broken!
a: Disregard these as they're junk tabs to make the website a little more entertaining to the eye.
